## Publishing and Dealing with yarn v2

> Disclaimer: Because we are using yarn v2 options from .yarnrc and .npmrc will be IGNORED. Please look into the [offical documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc) for the new file structure.

1. Authenticate using a personal access token. You find it under Settings->Developer Settings->Personal access token and generate one with `repo, read:packages, write:packages, delete:packages`.
2. Go into your users home folder and create `.yarnrc.yml`. There you add

```
npmRegistries:
